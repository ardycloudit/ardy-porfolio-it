# Ardy’s Cloud Portfolio

Hands-on AWS labs with steps, commands, and screenshots.

## Projects
- [EC2 + NGINX Lab](./ec2-nginx-lab/README.md)
- [S3 Versioning Lab](./s3-versioning-lab/README.md)
- [IAM Least-Privilege Lab](./iam-least-privilege-lab/README.md) *(coming soon)*

## How I work
- Keep SSH locked to **My IP (/32)**; use **Session Manager** when keys aren’t available.
- Document every lab with steps, commands, screenshots, and lessons learned.
